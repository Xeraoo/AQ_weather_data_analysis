# Air Quality and Weather Data Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes air quality data from GIOŚ using the `giosimport` package and explores correlations with weather data from NOAA's ISD. The goal is to forecast pollution levels and identify trends.

## Tools & Technologies
- **R**: Statistical programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **R Markdown**: Dynamic report generation integrating R code and documentation.
- **giosimport**: Package for importing air quality data from GIOŚ.
- **NOAA ISD**: Database of meteorological observations from global ground stations.

## Methodology
We gathered air quality data (PM10, PM2.5) and weather data (temperature, humidity) for the city of Radom. Statistical analysis was performed to explore correlations between pollutants and weather patterns, using Random Forest for forecasting.

## Data Sources
- **GIOŚ Air Quality Monitoring**: PM10, PM2.5 concentrations.
- **NOAA ISD**: Hourly meteorological data from local stations.

## Result
The analysis revealed strong correlations between weather conditions and air pollution levels, helping improve forecasting accuracy.
